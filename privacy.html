		<h1>FormKey</h1>
	
		<p>Hello there!</p>
		<p>FormKey is a project from the 20lines team to help you with the innumerable forms you have to deal with every day!<br />
		FormKey (&ldquo;<em>FormKey</em>&rdquo;, the &ldquo;<em>App</em>&rdquo;) is a keyboard that you can easily install on your iOS device.</p>
		<p>To help you better understand how the App works, we put things in clear in the following Privacy Policy.</p>
		<h2><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Our Privacy Policy.<br />
			Everything you type on FormKey is 100% private. FormKey doesn&#39;t record key strokes and doesn&#39;t transmit any personal information to us or to third-parties. Where we refer to &ldquo;Personal information&rdquo; in this privacy policy we mean any information that may identify you as an individual.</li>
			<li>Local storage of Personal information.<br />
			We don&#39;t collect, nor receive by the App any Personal information about you. Your data is stored locally on your device and is not accessible by anyone remotely.</li>
			<li>Access to activities and information.<br />
			The App requires &quot;Allow Full Access&quot; to your device when initially setup. This happens because the App needs to be available for usage throughout the different apps you use.<br />
			When you allow full access in the settings under &ldquo;Add new keyboard&quot; tab, a warning message will pop up stating &ldquo;Full access allows the developer to transmit anything you type, including things you have previously typed with this keyboard. This could include sensitive information such as your credit card number or street address.&quot; This alert appears when the keyboard is trying to share anything with the encapsulating app.<br />
			We only collect anonymous usage statistics and crash reports. All data is anonymous and is only used to fix bugs, crashes, and improve the App. Collected statistics are never shared with third parties. No usage statistics of the App is collected in any shape or form.</li>
			<li>How we may communicate with you.<br />
			You may receive occasional notifications on your device alerting you to product updates and features that may be of interest to you. You can disable these notifications at any time by going to the Settings menu.</li>
			<li>How you may communicate with us.<br />
			For any question regarding FormKey, our privacy policies, or just for sending us reports or suggestions, you can email us at <a href="mailtop:formkeyapp@gmail.com">formkeyapp@gmail.com</a> and we&rsquo;ll be happy to reply within reasonable time.</li>
